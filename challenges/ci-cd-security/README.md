# CI/CD Security Challenge

## Challenge Overview
This challenge focuses on securing a CI/CD pipeline by identifying and fixing common security vulnerabilities in Jenkins. You'll learn how to implement proper security measures in a CI/CD environment.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand common CI/CD security vulnerabilities
- Learn to implement security scanning in pipelines
- Practice securing sensitive credentials
- Implement proper access controls
- Secure artifact handling

## Prerequisites
Before starting this challenge, ensure you have:
1. Docker and Docker Compose installed
2. Basic understanding of Jenkins and CI/CD concepts
3. A web browser to access Jenkins
4. Git installed for cloning the repository

## Challenge Setup
The challenge environment includes:
- A vulnerable Jenkins pipeline
- Exposed credentials
- Missing security scanning
- Improper access controls
- Insecure artifact handling

## Expected Outcomes
By completing this challenge, you will:
1. Identify and secure exposed credentials
2. Implement proper secret management
3. Add security scanning to the pipeline
4. Configure appropriate access controls
5. Secure artifact handling

## Challenge Tasks

### Task 1: Finding Exposed Credentials
- Identify credentials exposed in the pipeline
- Document the security risks
- Plan the remediation

### Task 2: Implementing Secret Management
- Create secure credential storage
- Update pipeline to use secure credentials
- Verify credential security

### Task 3: Adding Security Scanning
- Install security scanning plugins
- Configure scanning tools
- Implement quality gates

### Task 4: Configuring Access Controls
- Set up proper authentication
- Implement role-based access
- Configure least privilege

### Task 5: Securing Artifact Handling
- Implement secure artifact storage
- Add artifact signing
- Configure secure distribution

## Solution Verification

### Credential Security
- [ ] No credentials exposed in pipeline configuration
- [ ] All secrets stored in credential store
- [ ] Credentials properly masked in logs

### Security Scanning
- [ ] OWASP Dependency Check installed
- [ ] Security scans running on every build
- [ ] High severity vulnerabilities blocked

### Access Controls
- [ ] Proper authentication configured
- [ ] Role-based access implemented
- [ ] Least privilege principle followed

### Artifact Security
- [ ] Artifacts properly archived
- [ ] Builds fingerprinted
- [ ] Sensitive files cleaned up

## Scoring
- Base completion: 100 points
- Additional security measures: Up to 50 points
- Time bonus: Up to 50 points

## Badges
- CI/CD Security Expert (Bronze)
- Pipeline Guardian (Silver)
- DevSecOps Master (Gold)

## Getting Started
1. Follow the setup instructions in [SETUP.md](SETUP.md)
2. Complete the tasks in [WALKTHROUGH.md](WALKTHROUGH.md)
3. Verify your solution using the checklist above

## Common Issues
1. **Jenkins won't start**
   - Check port 8080 availability
   - Verify Docker is running
   - Check container logs

2. **Can't find exposed credentials**
   - Review pipeline configuration
   - Check environment variables
   - Look for hardcoded secrets

3. **Security scanning not working**
   - Verify plugin installation
   - Check plugin configuration
   - Review scan logs

## Tips for Success
1. Take notes as you go
2. Document each security improvement
3. Test your changes thoroughly
4. Use the Jenkins documentation
5. Don't hesitate to ask for help
